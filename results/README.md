### Here we provide the results of running EGP only on publicly available genomic datasets. 

#### Links to Results of Our Analyses of Public Datasets Using EGP

- [x] **Simons Genome Diversity Project**: Short-read WGS CRAM files were downloaded from the EMBL-EBI Public Data Globus Endpoint from the `/1000g/ftp/data_collections` directory. Post-download, the data was run through EGP version 1.3.
- [x] **Human Genome Diversity Project**: Short-read WGS CRAM files were downloaded from the EMBL-EBI Public Data Globus Endpoint from the `/1000g/ftp/data_collections` directory. Post-download, the data was run through EGP version 1.3.
- [x] **Gambian Genome Variation Project**: Short-read WGS CRAM files were downloaded from the EMBL-EBI Public Data Globus Endpoint from the `/1000g/ftp/data_collections` directory. Post-download, the data was run through EGP version 1.3.
- [x] **1000 Genomes Project 698 Related**: Short-read WGS CRAM files were downloaded through the paths present in this file `https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/1000G_2504_high_coverage/additional_698_related/1000G_698_related_high_coverage.sequence.index`.
- [ ] **1000 Genomes Project 2504**: Short-read WGS CRAM files were downloaded through the paths present in this file `https://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/1000G_2504_high_coverage.sequence.index`. Please note that the index files are there as well. You just have to append a `.crai`.
- [ ] **GIAB Trio**: Short-read WGS CRAM files were downloaded through the paths present in this file `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genome-in-a-bottle/giab_data_indexes/refs/heads/master/AshkenazimTrio/alignment.index.AJtrio_Illumina300X_wgs_novoalign_GRCh37_GRCh38_NHGRI_07282015`.
